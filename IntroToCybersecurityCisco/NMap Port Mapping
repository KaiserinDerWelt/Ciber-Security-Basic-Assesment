Nmap is a software application to detect the open ports of a network.
Attacking the port is one of the first steps to get in to a forbidden network.
Scanning the ports of a public / corporative network is normally the precursor to hack a network, reason why We should not 
perform this activity with no permission at the company we work or any other entitity.
